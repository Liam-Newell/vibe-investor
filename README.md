# Vibe Investor

## Project Overview
An intelligent options trading system that leverages Claude AI for volatility analysis, earnings timing, and strategic options selection. The system focuses on 6 concurrent options positions with 2-4 week holding periods, targeting realistic 20-30% annual returns through defined-risk strategies. Claude provides individual position analysis and portfolio-wide Greeks management.
